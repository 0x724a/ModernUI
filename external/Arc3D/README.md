# Arc3D
Arc3D is a modern graphics engine, which is written purely in Java 17 and based on LWJGL 3.3.3

### Components
#### Compiler
A compiler that compiles shaders written in Arc3D shading language into SPIR-V 1.0+, GLSL 3.30+,
and ESSL 3.00+, it is 6 to 70 times faster than glslang/shaderc/glslc.
#### Others are not listed

### Dependencies
Arc3D depends on LWJGL (OpenGL binding, Vulkan binding, Vulkan Memory Allocator), fastutil, and SLF4J API,
no other dependencies.

### Progress/Plan
Currently, Arc3D is used for [ModernUI](https://github.com/BloCamLimb/ModernUI).
