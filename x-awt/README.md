## Modern UI - AWT Extension
### Description
This library allows for using OpenGL and Vulkan LWJGL 3 surfaces in AWT (and by extension, Swing)
frames. Works with MacOS X, Windows, and Linux.

This extension is based on [lwjgl3-awt](https://github.com/LWJGLX/lwjgl3-awt), which is
included in binary and used internally.

This extension is WIP, and needs to implement the protocol between AWT and MUI view system.
