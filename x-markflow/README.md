## ModernUI - Markflow
### Description
Markflow is an extension of ModernUI framework that provides a flexible API for parsing Markdown and converting it into
Spanned text, which is used by the framework's text layout engine to display on the screen.

Markflow uses [commonmark-java](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java) as an API, supporting the CommonMark
specification along with some extensions.
